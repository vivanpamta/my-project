LibraryManagementUI.jsx (Component File):

Component Creation:
I created a functional component called LibraryManagementUI using React.

State Management:
books: Stores the current list of books (initially contains 1984, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird).
searchTerm: Stores what the user types in the search box.
newTitle and newAuthor: Store input values when adding a new book.

Functions/Logic Implemented:
addBook() → Adds a new book to the list if both title and author are filled in.
removeBook(index) → Removes a book based on its position in the list.
filteredBooks → Dynamically filters the book list according to the search term (matches both title and author).

User Interface:

Search bar to filter books.
Two input fields (title and author) + button to add a new book.
A styled list of all filtered books with a remove button next to each.


App.jsx (Main File):

I imported the LibraryManagementUI component.

Wrapped it inside the main App component.

Returned it inside a <div>, which makes it appear on the screen when the app runs.
