ProductCard.jsx:

I created a functional component named ProductCard.

This component receives three props: name, price, and status.

Inside the return statement, you designed a small card layout using inline CSS (border, padding, rounded corners,
fixed width, and centered text).

The card displays:
The product name inside a heading.
The product price with a $ symbol.
The product status (like In Stock or Out of Stock).

This makes ProductCard a reusable component that can show details of any product.



App.jsx: 

I imported the ProductCard component and used it inside the App component.

In App, I created an array of products (Wireless Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor), each with a name, price, and status.

I used the .map() function to loop through this array and render one ProductCard for each product.

I passed the productâ€™s data (name, price, status) as props to each ProductCard.

For styling:

I wrapped everything in a big box with a border, padding, and margin.

I used flexbox to place product cards side by side with equal spacing.

The final result is a Products List page where all products appear as styled cards.
