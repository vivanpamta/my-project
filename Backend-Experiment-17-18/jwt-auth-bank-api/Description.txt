1: JWT Banking API â€“ Explanation

The JWT Banking API is a Node.js and Express.js application designed to demonstrate secure 
authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users log in with a predefined username and
password to receive a JWT token, which is then required to access protected banking operations.


2: The API includes three main functionalities:

(a): View Balance: Users can check their current account balance. Access is restricted to
authenticated users via JWT verification.

(b): Deposit Money: Users can add money to their account. The system validates the input
amount and updates the balance accordingly.

(c): Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money if sufficient balance exists. The system ensures
the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance.

A middleware function is used to verify the JWT token on all protected routes, ensuring only
authorized users can perform sensitive operations. The API also handles common errors, such 
as missing or invalid tokens and insufficient funds for withdrawals, maintaining security
and data integrity.
