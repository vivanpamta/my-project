For HTML :
I have created a student registration form using a form tag.
Then in the form tag I have taken two HTML elements as input and label for name , email, age and submit button.
Then for name field I have taken input and label element and uses a validation of minlength and maxlength required.
Then same for the email, validation used is required if user will not enter the email it will show error and 
it will ask for to enter mail id 
Then for the age field we use validation as age min 1 and max 99 required if user will enter the age falling
out from the give range it will show error.
At last created a submit button.

For CSS :
First I have mapped HTML file with CSS file using <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.
Then I have given a background color aquamarine to the form .
