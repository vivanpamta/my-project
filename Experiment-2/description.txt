HTML : 

In the HTML part  I created the basic structure of a simple banking interface.
I started by using the div tag to make two boxes  an outer box and an inner box.
The outer box  acts like a container that holds everything and helps center the content on the screen.
Inside this outer box I placedanother box called inner_box, which contains the main content.
In the inner box I added a heading  h1 that displays the current balance which is shown as $0.
Below the heading I added two buttons one for depositing money and one for withdrawing money.
These buttons are placed inside their own div blocks  to keep them organized. 

 CSS :

In the CSS part  I styled the web page to make it look clean. 
I started by setting the background color of the page to a light grey and used flexbox to center
everything in the middle of the screen.
I gave the outer box a light background color rounded corners and a shadow to make it look like organize.
Inside this, the inner box has a white background some padding rounded corners and a smaller shadow for a neat look. 
I also styled the heading to make the balance amount look clear.
For the buttons I gave them padding and made their corners rounded.
I used green color for the Deposit button to show it's for adding money, and red color for the Withdraw
button to show it's for taking money out.
