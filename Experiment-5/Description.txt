JavaScript :

1: const products = [
    { name: "T-Shirt", category: "Clothing" },
    { name: "Jeans", category: "Clothing" },
    { name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics" },
    { name: "Smartphone", category: "Electronics" },
    { name: "Novel", category: "Books" },
    { name: "Cookbook", category: "Books" }
];
Here I made an array called products.Each item has a name like T-Shirt and a category like "Clothing.



2: const categorySelect = document.getElementById("categorySelect");
const productItems = document.getElementById("productItems");

Then I took two things from HTML: The dropdown menu so I know which category is selected.The empty box 
where products will be shown.


3: function renderProducts(category) {
    productItems.innerHTML = "";
    let filtered = (category === "All")
        ? products
        : products.filter(product => product.category === category);

    filtered.forEach(product => {
        const div = document.createElement("div");
        div.className = "product-entry";
        div.textContent = product.name;
        productItems.appendChild(div);
    });
}
I wrote a function called renderProducts.This function clears the box first.If the dropdown says All it
shows everything. If a category like Clothing is selected it only shows products from that category.For
each product it creates a small box with the productâ€™s name and puts it inside the main box.


4: categorySelect.addEventListener("change", () => {
    renderProducts(categorySelect.value);
});
I added an event listener to the dropdown.This means whenever the user changes the category the function 
runs again and updates the product list.


5: renderProducts("All");
At the end I called the function one time with All so that all products are visible when the page first loads.
