Description : 

In this experiment, I upgraded the login flow by adding an OTP-based second authentication step. 
After entering correct username and password, the system sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user 
(via console for demo). The user must enter the correct OTP to complete authentication.This provides 
an extra security layer beyond just a password, making unauthorized access much harder 
even if credentials are leaked.


The program flow:

User submits login credentials
System validates username & password
System generates OTP and displays it (simulated SMS)
User enters the OTP
System verifies OTP and grants access if correct

This demonstrates multi-layer secure authentication used in real systems like banking apps, Gmail, 
etc.


Key Features : 

Password + OTP authentication
OTP generation & verification
Session-based temporary OTP storage
Improved security model over single-factor login
