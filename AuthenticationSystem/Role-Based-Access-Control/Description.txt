Description : 

In this experiment, I implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using JWT. Users are assigned 
different roles, and based on those roles, they are allowed or denied access to specific APIs.

After login, the JWT token includes the user’s role. Middleware functions validate both the token 
and the role before giving access to certain routes.


For example:

Admin route accessible only by users with role "Admin"
Moderator route accessible only by "Moderator"
User profile accessible by any logged-in user

This replicates real-world authorization used in enterprise applications like admin dashboards, HR 
systems, banking portals, etc.


Key Features :

Role-based route protection
JWT token containing role data
Middleware for role verification
Separate endpoints for admin, moderator & normal users
