Description : 

In this experiment, I implemented a backend system that validates user login credentials and generates 
a secure JWT token upon successful authentication. The token is then used by the client for accessing 
protected API routes.The application stores users and their credentials. When the user logs in, their 
username and password are verified. If correct, a JWT token is created and returned.For every protected 
route, the token must be passed in the Authorization header. The server then verifies the token, and 
if it is valid, grants access to protected content.This method ensures stateless authentication — the 
server does not need to maintain session data; instead, token verification handles access control.


Key Features :
User login with JWT token generation
Token-based authentication for secure APIs
Middleware for token verification
Unauthorized users are blocked from protected routes
